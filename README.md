### Introduction  

+ There are many serial communication protocol as I2C, UART and SPI. 
+ A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a block of 
circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication. 
+ UART is Full Duplex protocol (data transmission in both directions 
simultaneously)

- Transmitting UART converts parallel data from the master device (eg. 
CPU) into serial form and transmit in serial to receiving UART.   
- Receiving UART will then convert the serial data back into parallel data 
for the receiving device.

## Specifications

* UART RX receive a UART frame on RX_IN. 
* UART_RX support oversampling by 8, 16, 32  
* RX_IN is high in the IDLE case (No transmission). 
* PAR_ERR signal is high when the calculated parity bit not equal the received frame parity bit as this mean that the frame is corrupted. 
* STP_ERR signal is high when the received stop bit not equal 1 as this mean that the frame is corrupted. 
* DATA is extracted from the received frame and then sent through P_DATA bus associated with DATA_VLD signal only after 
checking that the frame is received correctly and not corrupted
(PAR_ERR = 0 && STP_ERR = 0). 
* UART_RX can accept consequent frames without any gap. 
* Registers are cleared using asynchronous active low reset 
* PAR_EN (Configuration)     
0: To disable frame parity bit       
1: To enable frame parity bit 
* PAR_TYP (Configuration)        
0: Even parity bit  
1: Odd parity bit 

##  Expected ReceivedFrames  

1.  Data Frame (in case of Parity is enabled & Parity Type is even)  
 – One start bit (1'b0)  
– Data (LSB first or MSB, 8 bits)   
– Even Parity bit   
– One stop bit

## Oversampling 

Oversampling is a technique used in UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) to improve the accuracy of data reception by sampling the incoming signal multiple times within a single bit period. This helps to minimize the impact of noise and timing inaccuracies. Here's an in-depth look at oversampling
