### Introduction 
+ There are many serial communication protocol as I2C, UART and SPI. 
+ A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a block of 
circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication. 
+ UART is Full Duplex protocol (data transmission in both directions 
simultaneously)

- Transmitting UART converts parallel data from the master device (eg. 
CPU) into serial form and transmit in serial to receiving UART.   
- Receiving UART will then convert the serial data back into parallel data 
for the receiving device.
